#MattRSA

MattRSA is a Java-implemented RSA encryption and decryption utility I wrote for my cryptography course.  This utility implements:

* Encryption
	* Encrypts "MyMessage.txt" to "MyCyphertext.txt"
	
* Decryption
	* Decrypts "TheirCyphertext.txt" to "TheirMessage.txt"
	
* Generation
	* Generates the M, E, and D integers for encryption
