Skills Documentation
====================

This repository contains brief examples of my work in various fields of study over the course of my education at Appalachian State University. Some examples were created for specific courses, while others were made for fun or extracurricular experimentation.

A copy of my resume is also included.

Feel free to check out [my website](http://www.matthefner.com).  I wrote and maintain the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP behind the site as a personal project.

Cartography Portfolio
---------------------

During a semester long study of Cartographic Design and Analysis, I learned much about cartographic theory and Adobe Illustrator. Examples of my work and a deeper reflection of my experience is included in this folder.

Java Work
---------

Here you will find two distinctly different entries:

-   The first is a collection of implementations of Data Structures, Algorithms, and various other fundamental theoretical Computer Science concepts.

-   The second is a collection of Java code written mostly with the Processing Java API. Consequently, these will generally not run as standalone programs. They are intended only as demonstrations of my code writing ability.

JavaScript Games
----------------

As a hobby, when I'm not playing guitar, I find joy in implementing both classic games (like Frogger and Collapse), my own concepts for games, and various other visualizations of concepts in Math, Music, and Computer Science. In this folder you will find a brief collection of the source code for these projects, many of which are available as working examples on [my website.](http://www.matthefner.com)

Mathematical Modeling
---------------------

I deeply enjoy building, interpreting, optimizing, and implementing mathematical models. In a sense, much of a degree in Mathematics is learning some form of modeling. Documentation of specific modeling projects can be found in this folder.

Numerical Methods, Analysis, and Computation
--------------------------------------------

In this folder you will find deep dives into the mathematical theory behind computation from courses taken as a part of my Computational Mathematics concentration. Implmentation of various algorithms and simulations are provided as a brief example of my experience with Python.

Statistical Data Analysis and Visualization
-------------------------------------------

These skills were initially acquired in a Statistical Data Analysis course and were built upon with personal projects completed in my free time. The skills are, specifically:

-   Extensive coding experience in R

-   Data acquisition, visualization and analysis

-   Creating websites and typesetting in RMarkdown
