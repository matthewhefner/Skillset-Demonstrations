# Numerical Methods and Analysis

The PDFs in this folder are brief demonstrations of fundamental algorithms and concepts within computational mathematics.

The python routines are implementations of some of these concepts.

The page numbers referenced are from the book *Numerical Mathematics and Computing, 7thEdition*, Cheney and Kincaid, Brooks/Cole, Boston, 2013.
