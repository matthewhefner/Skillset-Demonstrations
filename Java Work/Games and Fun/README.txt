# Games and Fun

This folder is a collection of Java code written mostly with the Processing Java API. Consequently, these will generally not run as standalone programs. They are intended only as demonstrations of my code writing ability and interest in fractals, cellular automata, and agent based modeling.  Some of the projects in this folder are still under development and are updated regularly.
