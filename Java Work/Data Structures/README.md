# Data Structures

Written over the duration of a course in Data Structures, this folder contains implementations, demonstrations and experiments with various data structures and algorithms.

Projects selected for inclusion:

* Fun with Hash Functions
	* *Prog.java* seeks to compute collisions of provided hash functions in *HashFunctions.java*.
* Fun with Hash Tables
	* The first goal of this project was to implement a String set with a Hash Table in *StringSet.java*, the nodes of which are constructed in *StringNode.java*, and implement a Spell Checking application, using the String set and *dictionary.txt*.
	* The second goal of this project was to fund the closest points within *points.txt*, all within the unit square, which is achieved in *Closest.java*.
* Integer Set
	* The goal of this project was to simply implement and rigorously test an integer set data structure with both underlying array and linked list implementations.
* Pyramidals
	* *Pyramidal.java* searches for the minimal number of pyramidal numbers required to sum to the integers up to and including the command line input, up to 4 pyramidal numbers, in O(log(n)) worst-case time complexity.
* Stack - Molecular Mass
	* This project uses an integer stack to compute the molecular mass of a given input molecule consisting of Carbon, Hydrogen, or Oxygen.
