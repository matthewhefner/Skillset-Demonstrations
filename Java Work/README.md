# Java Work

In this folder, there are two sub-folders:

* Data Structures
	* Written over the duration of a course in Data Structures, this folder contains implementations, demonstrations and experiments with various data structures and algorithms.
	
* Games and Fun
	* This folder is a collection of Java code written mostly with the Processing Java API. Consequently, these will generally not run as standalone programs. They are intended only as demonstrations of my code writing ability and interest in fractals, cellular automata, and agent based modeling.  Some of the projects in this folder are still under development and are updated regularly.

There are other sections of this repository that contain Java code; in particular, the Mathematical Modeling folder contains several examples of code written for specific mathematical modeling applications and experiments.
