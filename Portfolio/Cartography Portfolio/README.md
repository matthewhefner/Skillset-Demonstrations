Reflection On Cartographic Design And Analysis

My path as a Computational Mathematics major at Appalachian has been very dense in courses that hold little to no focus on aesthetic qualities of the required work. Despite this, I am driven to put forth my best, most thorough work whenever possible. I seek to be thorough because I seek to understand. The making of these maps was a wonderful opportunity to learn and train a valuable new skill set in visual arts. Producing thorough work required pouring serious attention to detail into these maps (a fact better demonstrated once I surmounted the initial Illustrator-hump). It is my belief that this portfolio illustrates this care and progression of facing and eventually overcoming these new challenges.

While I have always held a strong interest in maps, I have never had an opportunity to delve deeply into their design and use as afforded to me by this course. The Communication Pathways Model very much shifted the way I view maps. With this model in mind, I was able to begin developing an appreciation for the clarity of a map's message, for the interactive and dynamic nature of design, and for ethical concerns within Cartography. When I began to approach my own designs with this outlook, the importance of aesthetic design characteristics, like balance, hierarchy and figure-group distinction, became immediately apparent. Good aesthetic design is crucial to communicating your message to the reader.

Simply understanding this, however, is an entirely different animal than effective implementation of it. I had previously never considered the extent to which one small change can hinder or improve map interpretation. Seemingly small changes, like nudging an element left or right, or using a sans-serif typeface instead of a serif typeface, can completely alter the overall look of a map. With this, I learned just how large a portion of total map design "tweaking" elements can be. You may spend hours shifting map elements in illustrator to no avail.

Other times, you believe your product to be wonderful and your message to be crystal clear, and you're wrong. During the late stages of production for each map after the Choropleth map, I regularly consulted (bugged) a few close, reliable friends for their feedback on my design choices. It was incredibly helpful in not only catching mistakes, like mislabeling a legend, but also for developing an eye for designing for effective communication.

As the course progressed and I became more comfortable experimenting with design decisions, my maps improved from one to the next. I spent some time making my very own scale to not have only a plain, solid black line. I experimented with title placement and size. In the final maps, I began experimenting with lettering beyond simply size and font, like tracking and shifting the baseline. I also began experimenting with color. The ultimate culmination of these experiments is my final, color map. A great deal of time was spent obtaining the data for this map, and every element was thoroughly thought through. It's simple, its message is clear, and the colors are gorgeous. The map is far from perfect, but I feel it best exemplifies the work and care I've striven to bring to these maps as I've learned and experimented throughout the semester.
