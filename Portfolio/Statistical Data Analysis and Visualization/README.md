This folder contains two files:

The first is a brief reference I created to summarize fundamental concepts and their use in R.

The second is a Weather Data Acquisition and Visualization project I created for fun.  It is only the raw source code with minor comments.  For a full explanation of this project and the results of the code, please visit http://matthefner.com/randomCreations/weather/index.html
