# Statistical Data Analysis and Visualization with R 

*This folder contains two files:*

* A brief reference I created to summarize fundamental concepts and their use in R.

 * A Weather Data Acquisition and Visualization project I created for fun.  
 
The second is only the raw source code with minor comments.  For a full explanation of this project and the results of the code, please visit the [weather section of my website.] (http://matthefner.com/randomCreations/weather/index.html)
